This is a test of the Oral History as Data documentation, using four interviews from the Context podcast. 

For more Context, see the [Context Podcast Digital Collection](https://lib.uidaho.edu/digital/context)

## About the interviews

I chose these four interviews because they each reference horror or mythical creatures and it is fall.

## A Quote from Bram Stoker's Dracula

"I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul."

## A Quote from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

“Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself.”
